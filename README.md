# Pie Menu Editor Fork

## Overview
This repository is a community-driven maintenance project for the Blender addon "Pie Menu Editor (PME)" Under the terms of the GPL license, we are exploring a sustainable development model and focusing on expanding PMEâ€™s reach to a broader user base.

PME was originally developed by [roaoao](https://github.com/roaoao) in 2016 and made available on the [Blender Market](https://superhivemarket.com/products/pie-menu-editor?ref=7373) and [Gumroad](https://roaoao.gumroad.com/l/pie_menu_editor).

With PME, users could easily extend their custom UI and enhance their efficiency when working with Blender. Its ease of use and extensibility have consistently earned high praise from the user community.

Our goal is to ensure the long-term stability and growth of this exceptional tool within the Blender ecosystem.
