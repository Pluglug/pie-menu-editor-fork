# Pie Menu Editor Fork

## Overview

This repository provides ongoing maintenance and version updates for the Blender add-on *Pie Menu Editor (PME)*.

PME was originally developed by [roaoao](https://github.com/roaoao) in 2016 and made available on the [Blender Market](https://superhivemarket.com/products/pie-menu-editor?ref=7373) and [Gumroad](https://roaoao.gumroad.com/l/pie_menu_editor).

With PME, users could easily extend their custom UI and enhance their efficiency when working with Blender. Its ease of use and extensibility have consistently earned high praise from the user community.

My goal with this repository is to keep PME working, stable, and faithful to its original design — ensuring it continues to function seamlessly on modern Blender versions.

This repository is maintained by Pluglug with roaoao's knowledge and approval, and is published to assist in keeping PME up to date with evolving Blender versions.

This repository exists to maintain PME for existing users, not to replace the original commercial distribution.  
Users are encouraged to honor the value of both the original development and ongoing maintenance efforts.

The provided modification scripts aim to maintain compatibility and improve usability, but I make no guarantees regarding the software's functionality, safety, or compliance with applicable laws.

## Note on Forking

Forks for contributing pull requests are welcome.

This repository is a **maintenance fork**, not the original PME project.  
To prevent confusion about which version is actively maintained,  
**please keep your fork’s name as “pie-menu-editor-fork.”**

Altering the name of a fork can make it difficult for users to distinguish  
the maintained line from unrelated copies and may obscure the project’s lineage,  
which ultimately harms the original developer’s reputation.

If you only need a personal backup, please clone or download the repository  
instead of publishing a public fork.
